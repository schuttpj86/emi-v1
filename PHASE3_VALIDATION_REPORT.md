## Analysis of Discrepancies

### 1. Steady-State EMF (15.26 vs 18.66 V/km)
**Likely Causes:**
- Different conductor arrangement (we used Example 3.4 geometry)
- Earth resistivity differences (20 vs 100 Œ©‚ãÖm)
- Simplified mutual impedance calculations

**Impact:** Moderate - within engineering tolerance for preliminary analysis

### 2. Fault EMF (468 vs 1203 V/km)
**Likely Causes:**
- Screening factor estimation (we used k=0.3+0.1j, actual may be different)
- Complex fault current distribution not fully modeled
- Earth wire configuration differences

**Impact:** Significant - requires refinement for accurate fault analysis

### 3. Longitudinal Voltage (468 vs 66.8 V)
**Likely Causes:**
- Boundary condition modeling (open vs actual grounding)
- Transmission line equation implementation
- Different EMF distribution assumptions

**Impact:** Major - critical for safety assessment
